    <h3>The U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT)</h3>
    <div class="row border">
      <div class="col-6 border">
          <p>According to a class action lawsuit the USWNT filed, the players are not treated as equals to the men’s national team. All 28 female players sued the U.S. Soccer Federation, their employer,in March 2019, alleging they are paid less than the men and are provided with less support, despite their consistent outstanding performance. The lawsuit also argues the team’s success has “translated into substantial revenue generation and profits” for USSF and “during the period relevant to this case, the WNT earned more in profit and/or revenue than the MNT.”</p> 
          <p>Although the the men’s team brought in $10.8 million more for the federation in 2015, this is because of the incredibly large gap between earnings in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Remember, the men's team did not even qualify for the last world cup while the women's team won it in 2019.</p>
          <p>With a World Cup win, the max earnings for a USWNT player is $200,000, while a USMNT player could earn $1.1 million with a title.</p>

    <h3>The National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)</h3>
    <div class="row border">
      <div class="col-12 border">
        <p>The minimum salary in the NWSL is $16,538, while the maximum salary is $46,200. A report in 2016 said that USWNT members can have a higher max salary of $56,000, a number that has likely gone up. It is no surprising that these players get more, because they are the main attraction that brings in fans.</p>
        <p>The MLS has a reserve minimum salary of $56,250 and a senior minimum salary of $70,250. Salaries for the top USMNT players are much higher, and in the millions.</p>
        <p>Players who chose to play on international club teams can usually make much more money than if they say in the United States.</p>
        <p>The only countries that have equal pay for both of their men's and women's club teams are Brazil, England, Australia, Norway, and New Zealand.</p>
